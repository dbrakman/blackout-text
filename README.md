# Brainless Memetic Subsequence Generator
## Background
In the years since 2017, [Text Blackout](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/text-blackout) has become a no-skill "meme" generation technique used to regurgitate popular content and farm karma on Reddit. Its overuse has dramatically shortened the half-life of novel and funny ideas.

My hope for this tool mirrors Alfred Nobel's hope for dynamite: its brutal efficiency should discourage its use.
